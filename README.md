## Technical Details

Built with Gemini Multimodal Live API + Pipecat for realistic AI interactions.

<img width="500px" height="auto" src="./image.png">

**Features:**

- Ephemeral WebSocket voice mode
- Text and image HTTP chat mode
- WebRTC voice, camera, and screenshare chat mode
- Persistent conversation storage to a SQLite database

The Pipecat SDK supports both WebSockets and WebRTC. WebSockets are great for protoyping, and for server-to-server communication.

For realtime apps in production, WebRTC is the right choice. WebRTC was designed specifically for low-latency audio and video. (See [this explainer](https://www.daily.co/videosaurus/websockets-and-webrtc/) for more about WebRTC and WebSockets.)

## Getting setup

‚û°Ô∏è You will need a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

‚û°Ô∏è To use the WebRTC voice mode, you'll also need a [Daily API key](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup) (optional).

### Easiest Setup (Using Shell Scripts)

We've provided shell scripts for both Unix/macOS and Windows that handle the entire setup and running process:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Make the script executable (only needed once)
chmod +x dev.sh

# Set up environment, install dependencies
./dev.sh setup

# Run both client and server concurrently
./dev.sh dev
```

**Windows:**
```bat
# Set up environment, install dependencies
dev.bat setup

# Run both client and server concurrently
dev.bat dev
```

You can also run the client or server individually with `./dev.sh client`, `./dev.sh server` (or `dev.bat client`, `dev.bat server` on Windows).

### Alternative Setup (Using npm scripts)

You can also use the npm scripts to set up and run the application:

```bash
# Install dependencies for both client and server
npm install

# Set up environment, install dependencies, and configure both applications
npm run setup

# Run both client and server concurrently
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the client and server separately, follow these instructions:

#### Server setup:

You'll need to use Python version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 because of various dependencies. On a Mac, the easiest thing to do is `brew install python@3.12`.

```bash
cd server
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize the project
python sesame.py init

# Run the server
python sesame.py run
```
This will start the Sesame server. You'll need to make note of which port it's running on. Look for a log line that says something like `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`.

#### Client setup:

Option 1: Using the Sesame CLI

- From within the `server` directory:

  ```bash
  python sesame.py init-client
  ```

Option 2: Manually

- You can manually create the `.env.local` file in the `./client` directory:

  ```bash
  cd client
  cp env.example .env.local
  ```

  Open your `.env.local` file and make sure `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7860/api` is using the same port as your Sesame server (defaults to 7860).

#### Run the client:

In a new terminal window:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL shown in the terminal. Be sure that both the server and client are running.

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, you can run:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run setup` | Installs all dependencies and sets up both client and server |
| `npm run dev` | Runs both client and server concurrently |
| `npm run restart` | Restarts both client and server (waits 5 seconds for server to start before launching client) |
